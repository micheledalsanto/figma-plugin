### 🧾 Brief

**Generated Placeholder:**
```
GOAL
[What is this project trying to achieve? What does success look like?]
Example: Create a mobile-first budgeting app...
```

**Customized Version:**
```
GOAL
Create a mobile-first savings app that increases user savings rate by 20% through
automated round-ups, goal-based savings, and positive reinforcement. Success means
10,000 active users within 6 months, each saving an average of $200/month.

TARGET AUDIENCE
Primary: Millennials aged 25-34, urban professionals earning $50-80k/year
Secondary: Gen Z early-career professionals (22-26)
Behaviors:
  • Use Venmo, PayPal, digital banking daily
  • Check phone 150+ times/day
  • Struggle to maintain manual budgets (abandon after 2 weeks)
Pain points:
  • Feel guilty about spending but lack discipline to save
  • Overwhelmed by traditional financial planning tools
  • Want results without constant effort

CONTEXT & BACKGROUND
Why: 67% of millennials have less than $1000 in savings (Federal Reserve, 2023)
  • Market opportunity: $12B fintech savings app market
  • Business goal: Capture 0.5% market share in year 1
  • User need: Existing apps are either too complex (Mint) or too simplistic (Acorns)

SCOPE
In scope:
  • Automated round-up savings
  • Goal-based savings buckets (3 max)
  • Bank account linking (Plaid integration)
  • Basic spending insights
  • Push notifications for milestones

Out of scope (for v1):
  • Investment features
  • Bill payment automation
  • Credit score monitoring
  • Social features / shared goals

CONSTRAINTS
Timeline: 16-week MVP sprint (design + dev)
Budget: 1 designer, 2 developers (bootstrapped startup)
Technical: Must use Plaid for bank integration; iOS 14+ only
Business: Must comply with SOC 2; revenue model TBD (freemium vs. subscription)

### 🧠 Problem & Insights

**Generated Placeholder:**
```
PROBLEM STATEMENT
[One clear sentence defining the core problem]
Example: Young professionals want to save money but lack the time and knowledge...
```

**Customized Version:**
```
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Young professionals want to save money but lack the discipline and time to manually
track expenses, resulting in constant financial anxiety and poor savings outcomes.

SYMPTOMS (What users experience)
• 72% of users abandon budgeting apps within 3 weeks (internal study)
• Users check balances 3-5x/day but take no action (anxious monitoring)
• Average savings: $47/month despite earning $65k/year (3% savings rate)
• "I know I should save, but it never happens" — 9/10 user interviews

ROOT CAUSES (Why it happens)
Behavioral:
• Delayed gratification is psychologically difficult (present bias)
• Manual tracking feels punishing, not empowering
• Shame spiral: spending guilt → avoidance → more guilt

Systemic:
• Traditional tools require constant input (30+ min/week)
• Banks don't make saving easy (requires multiple manual steps)
• Financial literacy education is inadequate

Technical:
• Existing apps have poor categorization accuracy (60-70%)
• No predictive intelligence (reactive, not proactive)
• Cluttered interfaces overwhelm users

KEY INSIGHTS (What we learned)
💡 Insight #1: Users don't want to budget — they want to feel in control effortlessly
   → Implication: Automate everything; savings should happen invisibly

💡 Insight #2: Small wins (saving $5) motivate more than big goals (save $5000)
   → Implication: Celebrate micro-achievements; daily progress > monthly targets

💡 Insight #3: Shame kills engagement; positive framing sustains it
   → Implication: Never use red/negative language; frame as opportunity, not failure

💡 Insight #4: Trust is earned through transparency, not gamification
   → Implication: Always show "why" before asking for data/permissions

OPPORTUNITIES (What we'll focus on)
✓ Round-up automation: Save spare change from every transaction (0 effort)
✓ Positive reinforcement: Celebrate wins, never punish overspending
✓ AI-powered optimization: Learn patterns, suggest optimal savings automatically

### 🎨 Visual Direction

**Generated Placeholder:**
```
MOOD & FEELING
[3-5 adjectives that capture the aesthetic]
Example: Calm · Confident · Modern · Approachable · Trustworthy
```

**Customized Version:**
```
MOOD & FEELING
Calm · Optimistic · Trustworthy · Effortless · Human

REFERENCES & INSPIRATION
• Linear — Clean interfaces, purposeful micro-interactions
• N26 — Friendly fintech, approachable without being childish
• Stripe — Clarity and professionalism without sterility
• Headspace — Soft colors, gentle UX, calm vibes
→ Moodboard: figma.com/file/saveup-moodboard

COLOR STRATEGY
Intent: Calm optimism — avoiding both aggressive banking blues and overly playful
        pastels. Should feel trustworthy but never corporate.

Primary: #3B82F6 (Sky Blue 500) — CTAs, progress bars, key actions
Secondary: #10B981 (Emerald 500) — Success states, savings milestones
Neutrals: #F9FAFB → #111827 (Gray 50-900) — Backgrounds, text hierarchy
Semantic:
  • Success: #10B981 — "You saved $50 this week!"
  • Warning: #F59E0B — "Low balance alert"
  • Error: #EF4444 — Connection issues
  • Info: #3B82F6 — Tips and educational content

TYPOGRAPHY
Intent: Friendly, readable, modern — not corporate, not playful

Primary font: Inter — UI, body text, data
  • Weight range: 400 (Regular), 500 (Medium), 600 (Semibold)
  • Why: Excellent legibility at small sizes; neutral but warm

Display font: Inter — Large headlines (keeping it simple)
  • Weight range: 700 (Bold)
  • Why: Consistency > variety

Mono font: JetBrains Mono — Currency values, account numbers
  • Why: Crystal-clear distinction for financial figures

IMAGERY & GRAPHICS
Style: Soft gradients, abstract shapes, no literal money imagery

Rules:
  ✓ DO: Use subtle mesh gradients for backgrounds
  ✓ DO: Abstract progress visualizations (not literal piggy banks)
  ✓ DO: Show real data, not decorative charts
  ✗ DON'T: Stock photos of people holding credit cards
  ✗ DON'T: Dollar signs, coins, or literal money symbols
  ✗ DON'T: Overly playful illustrations (this is real money)

VISUAL PRINCIPLES
• Whitespace over clutter: 48px padding minimum; generous breathing room
• Soft over sharp: 12px border radius standard; no hard edges
• Clarity over decoration: Every pixel must serve a purpose

## Tips for Customization

### ✅ DO:
- Keep the structure (it's optimized for storytelling)
- Replace `[BRACKETED]` fields with your specifics
- Use real metrics when available
- Include concrete examples, not vague descriptions
- Show evidence (quotes, data, before/after)

### ❌ DON'T:
- Delete section headers (they guide the reader)
- Make it too brief (employers want depth)
- Use jargon without explanation
- Claim results you can't prove
- Leave `[BRACKETS]` in final version

## Adaptation by Project Type

### For Client Work:
- Emphasize business impact and stakeholder management
- Include client quotes/testimonials
- Highlight constraints and how you navigated them

### For Side Projects:
- Focus on learning and experimentation
- Be honest about scope ("built in 2 weekends")
- Emphasize unique approach or technology

### For Redesigns:
- Show clear before/after comparisons
- Quantify improvements (task time, error rate)
- Explain design decisions with evidence

### For Speculative Work:
- Label it clearly as "conceptual" or "unsolicited redesign"
- Focus on process and thinking, not claiming outcomes
- Acknowledge limitations (no user testing, no dev constraints)
